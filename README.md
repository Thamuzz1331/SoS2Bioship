Quickstart Guide
  - Building A Bioship:
    -  Acquire a Shipheart and organseeds from a quest that spawns a crashed bioship.   
    -  Research the appropriate techs and start rendering protein clay.
    -  Outline the bioship in protein scaffold walls and floors
         - Protein scaffolds of all kinds require protein clay, which can be created at the drug bench using meat and chemfuel.
     - A bioship requires food, it can be acquired by feeding meat or corpses to the ship. Expect a need for a large amount of food to grow the bioship  
     - Build a shipheart in contact with the scaffolds, it will convert surrounding scaffolds into shipflesh, which will spread and convert future scaffolds.
     - Buildings such as heatsinks, weapons, and other body parts are similarly placed as scaffolds that will be converted, as an example these include shields and sensors.
        - Some scaffolds (primarily ship turrets) can produce variable results when converted.
