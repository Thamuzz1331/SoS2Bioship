	Grow your own starfaring abomination.

	Step 1: Wait for something to fall from the sky.  Or go to the stars and hunt it.
	Step 2: Go to it, harvest its gooy innards.  You're looking for a heartseed and organseeds.
	Step 3: Research.
	Step 4: Render meat into protien putty.  You'll want a lot of meat and chemfuel on hand.
	Step 5: Breed organ seeds at the drug workbench.  One organseed, some meat, and some neutroamine will get you two organ seeds.  Organ seeds can be squeezed for neutroamine.
	Step 6: Use the putty to build scaffolds for your ship.  You'll want more neutroamine and organ seeds for the advanced scaffolds.
	Step 7: Build the heart.  Make sure you're ready to feed it.  It eats meat.  And corpses.  And wrecked ships.
	Step 8: The heart will convert scaffolds to flesh.  Watch your ship grow.

	Some scaffolds (mainly weapons) will grow into different building depending on your ship's genes.  Harvest the hearts of enemy bioships for more genes.

	Bioships store nutrition in fat deposites.  Nutrition is used to grow and heal.

	Bioships have an immune response to being exposed to inorganic thermofluid, and will destroy mechanical components with thermal conduits that touch them.

	You will think you have enough meat.  You are wrong.

	It is strongly recommended to save and reload after building a shipheart.

	Known Bugs:
	- When growing large areas the roof can sometimes collapse.  Saving and reloading will repair the missing roof, but not anything damaged in the collapse.
	- Building floors on top of shipflesh floors causes pawns to freeze trying to deconstruct the shipflesh floor.  No current workaround.
	- Launching the ship with no maws or all maws empty can result in the ship dying as soon as it reaches orbit.
